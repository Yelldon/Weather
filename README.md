# Weather
## A weather app written in Swift and SwiftUI

The purpose of this project is the showcase what you can do with SwiftUI, by creating a practical tool that everyone can use.

The goal of the project was to use a free service. So the chosen weather data comes from The National Weather Service [API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)

The project was primarily built for iOS devices, but you should be able to build the project on any Apple platform, including iPadOS, Mac, and VisionOS. But there are a number of issues and bugs effecting platforms other than iOS. In the future, these issues will be addressed to work on all Apple platforms across the board.
